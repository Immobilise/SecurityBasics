                            <h2>Social Engineering</h2>
                            <p>Social engineering is a tactic used by cybercriminals to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that may compromise security.</p>
            
                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Social engineering involves exploiting human psychology to gain access to systems, networks, or sensitive information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Common Techniques:</strong> Phishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating, and quid pro quo are some common social engineering techniques.</li>
                                <li><strong>Targets:</strong> Individuals, employees, and organizations are often targeted through various communication channels, including email, phone calls, and social media.</li>
                            </ul>
            
                            <h3>Highlights</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>üé£ Phishing Attacks:</strong> Phishing emails often impersonate trusted entities to trick recipients into providing personal information or clicking on malicious links.</li>
                                <li><strong>üé≠ Pretexting:</strong> Social engineers create false scenarios or personas to manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information.</li>
                                <li><strong>üç¨ Baiting:</strong> Attackers offer something enticing, such as free software or a USB drive, containing malware to infect the victim's device.</li>
                                <li><strong>üö™ Tailgating:</strong> By following closely behind an authorized person, an attacker gains physical access to restricted areas or systems.</li>
                                <li><strong>üíº Quid Pro Quo:</strong> Social engineers promise a benefit in exchange for sensitive information or access, such as offering technical support in exchange for login credentials.</li>
                                <li><strong>üß† Security Awareness:</strong> Educating individuals about social engineering tactics and promoting a culture of skepticism can help mitigate the risk of successful attacks.</li>
                                <li><strong>üîí Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Implementing 2FA adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to access accounts even if they obtain login credentials.</li>
                                <li><strong>üîç Verification Protocols:</strong> Establishing verification procedures for sensitive transactions or information requests can help validate the legitimacy of requests and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                            </ul>
