                            <h2>Laptop Security</h2>
                            <p>Laptops and desktops hold sensitive information that can be accessed if someone gains physical access to the device. 
                                It is important to secure these devices with strong passwords and enable auto lock features. Encrypting the data on the device can further enhance security. 
                                Biometrics should not be solely relied upon for device authentication. Disabling USB ports and being cautious when using someone else's computer are additional security measures to consider.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>💻 Strong Password:</strong> Put a strong password on your laptop or desktop to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                                <li><strong>🔐 Longer Passwords:</strong> Longer passwords are stronger and more difficult to crack.</li>
                                <li><strong>🌐 Biometric Consideration:</strong> Biometrics should be used as a username, not a password, and should be paired with a password for authentication.</li>

                            <h2>Phone Security</h2>
                            <p>Phone security is important as our phones carry a lot of sensitive information, such as private photos and sensitive documents. 
                                Phones are becoming more powerful and like mini PCs, so it's crucial to protect them. Setting a password or pin code is the first step, and using a long pin code or a combination of pin code and fingerprint is recommended. 
                                Encrypting our phones is also important and most phones come with this feature enabled. Locking the SIM card and enabling Smart Lock on Android can further enhance security. Guest mode is useful when sharing the phone with others. 
                                When charging the phone, it is advised to use your own charger and avoid public chargers to prevent data theft. Finally, it is recommended to know how to remotely wipe your phone in case it gets lost or stolen.</p>
